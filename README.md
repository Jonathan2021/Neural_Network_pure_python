# Artificial Neural Network from scrath using python

Runs on CPU. No required library (appart from math and random).

## Available tunable features:

- Neural network structure
- Activation function for each layer
- Learning rate scheduler
- Number of epochs
- Batch size
- Training and testing data
- Multiple output nodes (didn't test it yet though)

## Unsupported

- Applying additional metrics
- Optimizer other than SGD
- Softmax or other output layer activation that takes other neurons in layer in account.


## Warning

Tried only one test case for now. There probably are a ton of bugs.


Example is a linear regression problem.
